        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2015- Present</p>
            <p><strong>Relevant Experience for job:</strong>
            I have experience and understanding of the necessity and importance to maintain
            both good working relationships with co-workers and also give the best impression 
            of the store to customers through their interactions with me as I help them with whatever
            it is they require. Due to my past experience in the job I have an awareness of the standard
            of work required and also the knowledge of the store and products within the store which
            are commonly requested for by customers. This would aid me in carrying out the work in 
            the standard it would be expected from me. My farming background would also assist me in 
            this job, as I am no stranger to hard work.</p>

        <p><strong>Additional Information:</strong>
        My I.T. skills are of a high standard and have carried out many computer based projects at school,
        I have since went on to study Business Information Systems as college which is IT based. I can speak
        a high standard of Irish as well as a decent standard of German. I have a tractor licence and a provisional
        car licence. My literal skills are of a high standard and can take in and comprehend information very quickly.
        This would be of use when helping customers with their respective problems. I also have experience with welding,
        painting and power washing as well as a brief stint at construction when helping to carry out repair and maintenance
        work on the farm. I also took part in our Transition Year musical which played a big role in developing my
        confidence and allowing me the opportunity to stand before a large amount of people and become very
        comfortable with the situation. Public speaking is not a problem for me. I can also use coding 
        languages learnt at college such as VB.Net and HTML which evolve around internet development and 
        application software. I have a good understanding of accounting also.
