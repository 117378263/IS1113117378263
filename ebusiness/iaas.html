            In an IaaS model (<strong> such as Amazon</strong>), a cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components
            traditionally present in an on-premises data center such as that of the <strong>Argos</strong> <i>in store</i> Information System for buying and checking stock, including servers,
            storage and networking hardware. The iaas technology also provides a range of services to back up 
            those infrastructure components such as billing, monitoring stock levels as well as storage resiliency, 
            such as back-up, replication and recovery.

   <h1 style="color:red;" align="center"> The Benefits of Iaas</h1>
 <br/>
  <br/>
 
   
       
       <ol>
           <li><strong>Money Savings:</strong></li>
           An obvioous benefit is the lower infrastructure costs. The constant maintenance of hardware and 
           networking equipment is no longer needed, all that is required is a competent IT staff. there is 
           no requirement to constantly buy new equipment to deal with business upsets, further reducing costs.
           
           <br/>
             <br/>
           
            <li><strong>Scalability and flexibility:</strong></li>
            Another benefit is how an inudstry can scale up and down quickly in response to the economy.
             IaaS providers such as Amazon  generally have the latest, most powerful storage, 
             servers and networking technology to accommodate the needs of their customers.
            
            <br/>  <br/>
            
             <li><strong>Faster time to market:</strong></li>
             Competition is strong in every sector, and time to market is one
             of the best ways to beat the competition. Because IaaS provides
             elasticity and scalability, organizations can ramp up and get the
             job done (and the product or service to market) more rapidly.
             
             <br/>  <br/>
             
              <li><strong>Focus on business growth:</strong></li>
              Time, money and energy spent making technology decisions and hiring
              staff to manage and maintain the technology infrastructure is time not
              spent on growing the business. By moving infrastructure to a service-based model,
              organizations can focus their time and resources where they belong, on developing
              innovations in applications and solutions.
