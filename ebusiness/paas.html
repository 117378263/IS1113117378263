        <p align="center">
            Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a type of cloud computing offering in
            which a service provider delivers a platform to clients(<strong>such as cloud 9</strong>), enabling them
            to develop, run, and manage business applications without the need to build
            and maintain the infrastructure such software development processes typically
            require. As with other cloud services such as infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) 
            and software-as-a-service (SaaS), PaaS is offered via a cloud service providerâ€™s 
            hosted infrastructure. Users typically access PaaS offerings via a web browser.

                            The future of PaaS in cloud computing is evolving quickly. Technology
                            is constantly growing exponentially while some PaaS vendors evolve linearly.
                            Some PaaS solutions can lock you into a box, dictating languages and tools,
                            one size fits all, while open source improves connection among servers and 
                            workers. Even from an expense standpoint, only the best PaaS providers include
                            costs like deployment, infrastructure, management or support.
