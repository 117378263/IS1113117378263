          <p align="center"> Software as a service or Saas as it can be known is a method used 
          to deliver software over the internet in the form of a service. the first applications 
          for the consumer market included simple services such as webmail and and photo sharing.
          In terms of business services such as recruitment and expenses were the early innovations.
          Saas implementation is quick and easy as opposed to in-house project management groups which were 
          far more complex. A payment model for this type of service is monthly and based on usage
          which <strongly>heavily</strongly> reduces costs for businesses - another one of its many advantages.
