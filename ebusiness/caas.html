            In an caas model (<strong> such as Gmail</strong>), 
           There is a collection of different vendor services (Google) that facilitate business 
           communications. Organizations may use these and similar services to lower costs and
           increase efficiency for business processes involving audio or video telecommunications.

       <ol>
           <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong></li>
           Businesses large and small are moving more of their services to the cloud,
           and one of the primary reasons is enhanced collaboration. With cloud-based services like Gmail, 
           you can share data with other employees instantly across all of your departments and branch locations using 
           Gmails unique services such as google drive and instant mail.
           The collaborative tools that cloud-based communications services provide make it much easier to get 
           everyone on the same page in an efficient manner.
           <br/>
             <br/>
           
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong></li>
            The goal of every business is to grow, and you need to be thinking long-term to ensure that your current
            business model provides the elasticity needed for rapid expansion. Since Gmail composes such a large
            part of every user’s business model, it is reassuring to know that it can be scaled without headaches.
            With cloud-based services, you can easily scale your communications network efficiently and cost-effectively,
            making it superior to on-premises solutions.
            
            <br/>  <br/>
            
             <li><strong>Global Accessibility:</strong></li>
            Global access can be achieved through the cloud, and in an increasingly globalized
            business landscape can be achieved through Gmail, this is an attractive quality for business owners and solopreneurs
            alike. The global accessibility and versatility you can achieve with Gmail services is unmatched, it is accessible on demand,
           all you need is an <i>Internet Connection</i>.
             <br/>  <br/>
             
              <li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong></li>
             Business owners are typically overwhelmed with work on a daily basis.
             But the reliability, autonomy, and accessibility that come with Gmail can
             offer you relief beyond the basic features of the integral system itself…something every
             business owner appreciates and deserves.

       <h1 style="color:red;" align="center">The Future Of caas</h1>
        <p align="center">
         
         IaaS is bound to grow rapidly over the next few years.
         While putting an IaaS plan into action will save the larger
         businesses huge costs in energy budget, labor, and maintenance
         and network administration. But, IaaS will also gain traction
         for small businesses too. Cloud services, specifically IaaS, 
         are likely to take off in the near future because it offers businesses 
         both big and small a more cost-effective, practical and efficient way
         to build and manage your infrastructure.
