    <h1 style="color:red;" align="center">What is cloud storage?</h1>
    
    <p align="center">Cloud storage is a term that refers to online space that you can use to store your data. 
    As well as keeping a backup of your files on physical storage devices such as external hard drives or USB flash drives,
    cloud storage provides a secure way to remotely store your important data.
    Online storage solutions are usually provided using a large network of virtual servers that come with tools for managing files and organizing your virtual storage space. </p>
